                        <p class="accordioncontainertext ">A good process book includes all the stages of the design process from preliminary research through thumbnails, sketches, wire frames, comps, and final designs. It also explains the process through an incorporated narrative. Carefully chosen words and images demonstrate the thinking and development that led to your final design. </p>


                        <h3 class="accordiantitle" id="process2top">What goes into a process book?</h3>
                        <p class="accordioncontainertextmini "> Your process book should tell a coherent story through descriptions and pictures from beginning research to finished design. A thoughtful and well-designed process log becomes an important addition to your design portfolio. It tells a story. Bear in mind that books have introductions, captions, notes, and most importantly, a narrative—a beginning, a middle and an end. A 60-page collage of outtakes with no text is not a process book.<br> </p>
                        <p class="accordioncontainertextmini"> This page divides the process document into 6 sections that you can map onto the double diamond proces document</p>

                        <img src="../images/processphases.png" alt="Process Cycle" class="processcycle">
                        <p class="accordioncontainertextmini ">Bear in mind that a process doc, is also a design problem. Think of a way to communicate your process that unifies everything inside the book. Create a layout structure on a design application like InDesign, Illustrator, or Adobe XD, and plan what will go on each page. Pick your colours and fonts, you should also organise your book into sections - for example introduction, research, analysis, development, and conclusions and include a cover with your name, the project title, and the course title</p>
                        <p class="accordioncontainertext processalert"> !! Remember this isn't the only way to create a process document, use this as a base but confirm with your professors in case they want something specific.</p>

                                    Ideally, when you present your research in a process doc you should show everything: what did you read, listen to and look at? Who did you talk to? What do your notes look like? How did you decide what was most important? How did you know when you were finished with your research?

What do your notes look like? How did you decide what was most important? How did you know when you were finished with your research?
